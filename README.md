Snip to Text
This Repository is purely for practise purpose only, working with the streamlit visualization part in python.
1. The First project, helps the user to paste any screenshot and obtain copy friendly content. this app is still liable to changes, as it only considers English language. Further improvements can be made as per requirement. But as of now, i use this tool to make notes from any meetings where the presentation is being shared.

3. Please note, it is only considered to be english and the document must be clearly scanned and visible.
